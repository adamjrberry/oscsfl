# oscsfl - Open Source Cyber Security Filter List
Providing an effective and open source reporting mechanism for Domains and IP Addresses to help you improve your security.  
We plan to provide a UBlock Origin Filter List, alongside integrations with Rspamd.  
This intelligence is only effective if we work on it together. Submit a PR with domains/IPs to be added to the list, and we will review them.  

## Requirements for Submission  
- Please check that the domain/IP doesn't already exist in our lists.
- Please only report domains/IPs that are performing malicious, abusive, phishing or spam activities.
- Consider reporting the abuse to the WHOIS Abuse Contact. ```whois google.com``` for example can let you know the domain registrar and abuse contact.
- Please include the details of the abuse, including screenshots etc. This will help us to review these faster. 

## Removal from Blocklist  
- If you are an IP Provider and have been added to one of our filter lists, you can request removal via a PR. Please note that each submission is reviewed and we will not remove entries unless we are confident that the issue has been resolved. We DO NOT accept money to remove you from our blocklists.
- Removal requests are typically processed within 3-5 days, but may be quicker/longer depending on the number of requests.
